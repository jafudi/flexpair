        \cvsection{My passion}
            \begin{quote}
                Data science isn't a day job for me. Squeezing insights out of data has always been my passion since I first touched a computer at the age of 14. Funnily enough, I was already a year into my first consulting project after I graduated in applied mathematics when I learned this was called "data science". But it is not the bits and bytes that I care for. I deeply care about the end product that I enable with my work. Be it a customer thrilled by experiencing an inspiring new service or a therapy that makes someone's life more enjoyable. AbbVie is such a success story and I want to be part of continuing it beyond the year 2023. More and more I feel that I do not have to prove myself again and again that I can do the hands-on coding. In my future job I would like to put the accent more on translating business opportunities into data science speak and back, acting as an entrepreneur together with my team inside the enterprise. I am convinced that asking why questions is important in order to build the right solutions in a lean fashion. This is why I got additionally certified as an advanced design thinking practitioner in 2019.
